# README: this is a module built for use with: Oh My Vagrant!

class p4h::lesson14() {

	file { '/root/README':
		content => "##lesson14
For this lesson, please do the following:
* Build a simple two host cluster that uses this technique to run a task
** Make sure it only runs on one host, until you take the primary down
*** You can use the specially defined `vip` hostname/ipaddress for the vip
**** Using my puppet-keepalived module should make this easier
***** It also includes an automatic host/UUID exchange
* Is this a real DLM ?
** Name one edge condition to be aware of when using this feature

Hint:
* The oh-my-vagrant project automatically allocated a VIP and hostname for you!
** Look inside of /etc/hosts on any machine and you'll see it!
* The puppet-keepalived module is include in this p4h module
** It's easy to setup, just use:
class { '::keepalived::simple':
	#ip => '',
	vip => valid_vip,	# add your own value
	shorewall => false,	# or true if you prefer
	#password => '',	# should be automatic!
}

Bonus:
* Does it ever make sense to have more than one VIP?
** If so should they always be co-located?

Level 42:
* Add Exec['again'] support to puppet-keepalived's keepalived::simple class!
** This should make using this utility more complete

Happy hacking!\n",
